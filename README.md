## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository (or download and extract the zip file)
2. Using VSCode LiveServer, http-serve (from npm), or any other method to create an http server, open index.html in your browser
3. If you are not able to do this, you should be able to access the website fine using just your local filesystem. But there may be errors with localstorage consistency (mainly users, logins)
